The purpose behind this project is to decrease the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written in order to get an app or website off the ground. I really wanted to like noSQL databases but I really like the performance and scalability of SQL. I wanted to combine the best frameworks into a single project to be able to focus on more important aspects of projects, not just the setup and boilerplate of writing authentication. 

The aim of this project was to write very modular and extensible code in order for others to leverage it as they want. I've included 4 main routes for social authentication: Google+, Facebook, Twitter, and Github and made it fairly easy to add more. There is also an option for local authentication all of which leverage the fantastic Passport.js project. 

##Features##
  - Local authentication
  - Social Authentication (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Github)
  - Account CRUD - ability to link/unlink multiple social accounts
  - Authenticated Routes
  - Not having to write account creation/management boilerplate
  - Having an awesome stack and a SQL DB
  - Getting all of this for free
